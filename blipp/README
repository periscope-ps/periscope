Basic Lightweight Periscope Probes (BLiPP)

Use the Periscope protocols to report
data gleaned from /proc, including:
* cpu and memory info
* host name and IP
* network interface statistics
* per-process statistics

The sampling and reporting interval can be controlled
separately, e.g. one sample every 10 seconds and a
report with 6 samples every minute.
