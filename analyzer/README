Installing NetLogger

NetLogger (this package) Python modules must be installed and in
your Python path, i.e. check out this code:

        svn co https://bosshog.lbl.gov/repos/netlogger/trunk nl-trunk
        cd nl-trunk/python
		python setup.py install

Then make sure the install directory is in your PYTHONPATH.


Requirements

[Python](http://python.org) 2.5 or above


External Python modules

We recommend installing Python modules using
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip, which is a replacement for
easy_install (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall).

* Modules:
  + SQLAlchemy
  + web.py
* For testing:
  + mock
  + nose
  + paste

Install specific versions by typing `python setup.py install` from inside the
directories for these:

* lib/pystache - pystache template tool


Javascript modules

These are included in the source code:

* mustache.js (http://github.com/janl/mustache.js) is an implementation of the Mustache0(http://mustache.github.com/) template system in JavaScript.
* stringformat (www.masterdata.se/r/string_format_for_javascript/)
  - Help with some string formatting things.
* Highcharts (http://www.highcharts.com/) - Plotting library

These must be downloaded:

* jQuery (http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
    JavaScript library for lots of things. You will need to do a "save link as"
    on the latest current release. Then copy jquery-*.*.*.min.js to
    static/js/jquery.min.js

* jQuery UI is the official jQuery user interface library.  Go to
  http://jqueryui.com/download, click on "Deselect all" on the Effects, and
  then download the library.

  After unzipping, copy js/jquery-ui-*.*.*.custom.min.js to
  static/js/jquery-ui.custom.min.js.  Copy css/ui-lightness to 
  static/css/ui-lightness.


Running

The main module is called by convention __main.py__.

To run this directly from the command line, type: `python main.py`.
Then navigate to the local web URL (http://0.0.0.0:8080/).


Testing

The tests are written using nose (http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/)
and paste (http://pythonpaste.org/), and live in the "test" subdirectory.

Running the tests is as easy as a single command: `nosetests`
