Tailable cursors support is not merge to the main branch yet.

    git clone git://github.com/ahassany/asyncmongo.git
    sudo python setup.py install
    
JSONPath
This package has a bug that have been reported and confirmed by the author.
Unfortunatlly the author didn't release new version yet. You need to change one
line in jsonpath source code.

open the jsonpath.py file usually located at /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/jsonpath-0.53-py2.6.egg/ or /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/jsonpath-0.53-py2.6.egg/
Comment out line #277 that says loc = re.sub(r'(?<!=)(=)(?!=)', '==', loc)
